# 🎯 Gameplay Mechanics
🍎 Regular Food
Increases snake length by 1
Appears randomly
Slightly increases game speed

# ⭐ Power Fruit
Appears randomly (~2% chance per frame)
Remains visible for ~30 seconds
Grants 10 seconds of invincibility
During invincibility:
Snake can pass through walls
Still dies on self-collision
Power timer shown at the top
Board and Display
Default size: 30×20
Range: 10×10 → 50×40
Modes: Emoji or ASCII, switchable anytime

# 🔧 Technical Details
Language: C++17
Dependencies: Standard Library only
Threading: std::this_thread::sleep_for() for timing
Cross-Platform I/O: Uses conio.h (Windows) / termios (Unix)
Screen Control: ANSI escape sequences for clean refresh

# 🐛 Known Limitations
Terminal emoji appearance depends on terminal font and scaling
Rapid key presses can occasionally queue extra moves
Small terminals may truncate board display

# 💡 Future Enhancements
Add difficulty levels
Implement high-score tracking
Introduce obstacles in between
Add local multiplayer mode
Optional sound effects (via SDL or SFML)

# Requirements
C++17 or later
Compatible Compilers: g++, clang, or MinGW
